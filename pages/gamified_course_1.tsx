          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold">What is Problem?</h2>
          <p >
          For a while now, I have been working on a gamified interactive course that focuses on teaching problem-solving skills using the Java programming language. I faced two main challenges while creating the course:
          <ol className="ml-12">
            <li>1. How to use the appropriate gamification elements and understand why they are effective.</li>
            <li>2. How to ensure that learners are able to apply the Java concepts they are learning to solve problems.</li>
            </ol>
          </p>
          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold">What is Solution?</h2>
          <p>
          To address these challenges, I used the Octalysis framework and incorporated six core drives:
          <ol className="ml-12">

         
<li>1. <b>Development and Accomplishment:</b> To provide a sense of progress and achievement, I incorporated badges, coins, and points for completing certain tasks or solving problems.</li>
<li>2. <b>Social Influence and Relatedness:</b> To foster a sense of community and connection among learners, I allowed them to share badges and points on social media.</li>
<li>3. <b>Scarcity and Impatience:</b> To create a sense of urgency and motivate learners to complete tasks, I used a countdown timer.</li>
<li>4. <b>Empowerment of Creativity and Feedback:</b> To encourage learners to think creatively and receive feedback on their problem-solving skills, I provided feedback after each problem was solved.</li>
<li>5. <b>Unpredictability and Curiosity:</b> To keep learners engaged and motivated, I created a store with different, random gifts.</li>
<li>6. <b>Loss and Avoidance:</b> To motivate learners to avoid losing progress, I used a system of coins that could be lost by not solving a problem correctly.</li>
</ol>
To tackle the second challenge, I found a way to integrate Articulate Storyline with the editor, checked the results, and then printed it.
