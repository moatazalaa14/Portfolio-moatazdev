title="PowerShell Video-based Course Project - Demo"
      description="This page showcases a video-based course project on PowerShell, created by an Moataz Alaa instructional designer. The demo provides an overview of the course content, which covers a comprehensive range of topics, starting from the basics and progressing to more advanced concepts. The page outlines the tasks involved in creating the course, from researching the topic to uploading it on the LMS. The instructional designer works closely with subject matter experts (SMEs) to determine the final course outlines, and the script is reviewed to ensure quality content. The media team then creates the video content, and the designer provides a clear storyboard for them. The course is designed to meet specific learning objectives, and assessments are created to ensure that the objectives are met. This page is an excellent opportunity to preview the course project and gain insight into the instructional design process. If you're interested in learning PowerShell, this course project is a valuable resource that can help you enhance your knowledge and skills."
